- All ghosts now getting the correct max health per mobs

- Issues with creeper explosions and /ghost command has been fixed
- Updates later today will addressing other bug fixes and ghost buffs
- Ghosts will be able to "upgrade" their mob bosses. Similar to a tier list.
- Ghosts will start off being able to spawn any basic mob for 5 exp levels. Ghosts can then "upgrade" these mobs. there will be three stages of upgrades, each being more expensive and more powerful than the previous
- I believe this will bring much needed balance between mobs and players. Since Heroes can now progressively get stronger because they get to keep their items. Now ghosts will be able to get progressively stronger as well
