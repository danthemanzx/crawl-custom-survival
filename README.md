### **Server IP ·** `play.crawl-survival.com`

This server features a custom gamemode similar to manhunt where you must clear out dungeons and defeat monsters controlled by other players. Collect loot and defeat bosses to win!


***

### How to Play

Upon entering the server you must play as a **Hero** or **Ghost**. Spawn showcases a dungeon portal, hero shop, enchantment table, and regenerable resources. 

**Heroes** must search the dungeons in search of rare artifacts, collecting FIVE of these to win. However if a Hero dies they will rise as a Ghost in spectator mode.

**Ghost**s have the ability to possess monsters, and summon bosses. A Ghost must take the fallen body of a Hero to become a Hero.
