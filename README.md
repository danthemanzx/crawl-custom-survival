### How to Play

This server features a custom gamemode similar to manhunt where players must beat several dungeons and with monsters controlled by other players.

***

The spawnpoint for this gamemode features an island that has regenerative resources, a Hero shop, and a portal to the dungeons. Upon entering the server players must play as a **Hero** or **Ghost**. If all Hero slots are taken, players will be defaulted to Ghost.

**Heroes** must search the dungeons in search of rare artifacts, collecting FIVE of these to win. However if a Hero dies they will respawn as a Ghost in spectator mode.

**Ghost**s have the ability to possess monsters, and summon bosses. Ghosts must kill a Hero to become a Hero.
